% Exercise 8 Scratchpad

% multivariateGaussian has some nice examples of vectorized code.


% Part 4: Collaborative Filtering Gradient
[J grad] = cofiCostFunc([X(:) ; Theta(:)], Y, R, num_users, num_movies, num_features, 0);

% Part 5: Regularized cost
[J grad] = cofiCostFunc([X(:) ; Theta(:)], Y, R, num_users, num_movies, num_features, 1.5);


% Multivariate Gaussian Distribution (optional)
% 2:01 Say we have too many dimensions in our data to visualize effectively. Would not the
% anomalous cases remain apparent in a visualizable dataset
% after applying some dimensionality reduction technique,
% such as principal components analysis? Could this technique be used to target features
% for use in situations wherein the univariate distribution would be much more desirable
% to use than multivariate?

% stdnormal_rnd(R, C) returns an R x C matrix of normally-distributed random numbers
% with mean 0 & standard deviation 1.

X = stdnormal_rnd(10, 10);
X(:,1) = X(:,1) * 1.2;
X(:,3) = X(:,3) .^ 2;
X(:,7) = X(:,7) - .7;
X = [X; 1:10];
